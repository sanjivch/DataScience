1a CLT

1b Law of Large Numbers

1c Under what circumstances


2 Let x & y be independent Gausi


3 How is correlation similar to or different from covariance


4 Express ANOVA in your own words, share suitable example to explain


5 What is Mahalanobis distance how is it related to Gaussian distribution


6 What is multi-collinearity? What is its significance?


7 Please shared your views on Bayes Theorem and itâ€™s link to Likelihood estimation


8 What is entropy, explain the mathematical formulation


9 Share an example Hypothesis testing you performed recently, How is it fundamentally similar or different from a. Classification problem?


10 Define Goodness of fit test, discuss cases when it is used


Part B


1 In a Regression setting, when do you user R-squared vs RMSE

2 How is classification fundamentally different from Clustering

3 Can a supervised learning setting be thought of as a conditional expectation? If yes, can we say that a supervised learning is inherently biased? Open ended

4 How is Random Forest Regressor different from other Regressors. Please explain using its base formulation (Entropy Info gain)

5 Explain Bias Variance tradeoff

6 What is F measure, under what circumstances can we use it in its base form (Will you use HM every time, Precision recall related)

7 What is regularisation, why is it important. Share regularisation techniques you have used

8 What is convolution, please share an example which does not involve images

9 What are LSTMs, how are they different from CNN

10 How would you go about finding a batch size in a deep learning setting?


Part C


Scenario 1 - Training Data for Classification (5000 cols and 10 mn rows)


A) How do you you go about dimensionality reduction

B) Comment on above if the system has limited memory resources


Scenario 2 - Consider a classical scheduled system (ON TIME PERFORMANCE is IMPORTANT)


How do you go about solving such a business problem and which Machine Learning Techniques would you use for the same
