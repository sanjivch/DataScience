# Decision Trees

- [[Supervised Learning]] algorithm
- Used for both [[classifcation]] and [[regression]] problems
-  Top-down approach 

## Terminology

1. **Root Node** - represents entire population or sample. Can be divided into two or homogenous nodes.
2. **Decision Node** - place for splitting a node/sub-node into further branches
3. **Leaf Node** - also called *terminal node* - there is no further split possible i.e.,  the branch ends here

## Operations on a tree
1. **Splitting** - Divides the node(decision node) into two or more homogeneous sub-nodes based on a criteria.
2. **Pruning** - Process of removal of sub-nodes from a decision node
