## Gaussian Distribution
-  Also known as the *normal distribution*
-  Widely used model for the *distribution of continuous variables*

- **Geometric form** 
	Functional dependence of the Gaussian on $x$ is through the quadratic form
$$\Delta =\sqrt{(x−μ)^{T} Σ^{−1} (x−μ)}$$which appears in the exponent. 
The quantity $\Delta$ is called the **[[Distances#Mahalanobis|Mahalanobis distance]]** from $μ$ to $x$ and reduces to the **[[Distances#Euclidean|Euclidean distance]]** when $Σ$ is the identity matrix.
