# Random Forests

## TL;DR
- [[Supervised Learning]] Method
- ensemble method
- uses bagging

Combines multiple [[Decision Trees]] and comes up with a prediction. builds on randomly generated decision trees and the model is average of the decision trees, inherently reducing the overfit. Also, does not need the features to be scaled/transformed
